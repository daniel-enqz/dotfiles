# Startup
[![CI](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/dotfiles/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/daniel-enqz/dotfiles/actions/workflows/main.yaml)
### Hello, Im @daniel_enqz üëã. <br>
### This guide has help me learn more about bash and overall have better management of my day-to-day workspace. Hope it helps to whoever finds this. üçÄ

> I use Iterm2 with zsh shell.<br>
> We will be using zim, a super fast framework with useful modules and themes without compromising speed. You can check documentation [here](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#manual-installation), but if you follow this guide steps you will be all set up.

### This are the efficiency numbers that you can approximately achieve with this guide. <br> (Opens 10 terminals in less than 1 second) ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

# Nice Terminal, Nice Theme:
> 1. brew install --cask iterm2
> 2. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/main/coolnight.itermcolors --output ~/Downloads/coolnight.itermcolors` (Import this theme from iTerm2 settings)

# First steps
> 1. Check for zsh installation `zsh --version`
> 2. Uninstall any other framework you may have installed (Ex. `uninstall_oh_my_zsh`)
> 3. Set Zsh as the default shell, if you haven't done so already:

```zsh
chsh -s $(which zsh)
````

# Installation
- Be sure that you have installed [brew](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#homebrew), [python](https://github.com/lewagon/data-setup/blob/master/macOS.md#installing-python-with-pyenv), [node](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#nodejs), [yarn](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#yarn) and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#postgresql).

> 1. `cd ~`
> 2. `git clone git@github.com:daniel-enqz/dotfiles.git`
> 3. `sh .dotfiles/startup/startup.sh`
> 4. Run `brew update && brew upgrade && zimfw update && zimfw upgrade`
> 5. After all this commands you can consider installing your rbenv, node, python versions, [gems](https://github.com/lewagon/setup/blob/master/macos.md#ruby), *zim modules*, etc.

## üéâ You are all set!!! Check the following resources:

> IMPORTANT: I will not cover all the files under shell/lib, but there's some interesting stuff like _aliases and functions_ you can give it an glance üëÄ.

### üå± Everything starts with `startup.sh`:

#### It will source two important files: 
- link_files.sh
- install_packages.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source "$DOTFILES_DIR/startup/lib/link_files.sh"
source "$DOTFILES_DIR/startup/lib/install_packages.sh"
```

#### ü¶¶ About `link_files.sh`

```bash
TEMP_DOTFILES_DIR=/Users/daniel-enqz/.dotfiles

ln -s "$TEMP_DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zshenv" "$HOME/.zshenv"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/git/.gitconfig" "$HOME/.gitconfig"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/lazy/" "$HOME/.gitignore_global"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.hushlogin" "$HOME/.hushlogin"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zshrc" "$HOME/.zshrc"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zprofile" "$HOME/.zprofile"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zimrc" "$HOME/.zimrc"
ln -s "$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zim" "$HOME/.zim"
```

> This file creates symbolic links of files in this repo to your home_path `~`. <br>
> For example it will create a symbolic link at `$HOME/.zshrc` that points to `$DOTFILES_DIR/shell/zsh/.zshrc` file. <br>
> **ü™¥ Important:** The existing .zshrc file in your home directory will be replaced by this symbolic link.
> **ü™¥ Important:** You can add more symbolic links, and just run the file with: `run_symbolic`

#### ü¶¶ About `install_packages.sh`

```bash

brew services stop --all
brew bundle --file="$DOTFILES_DIR"/exports/brew/Brewfile --force

pip install -r "$DOTFILES_DIR/exports/pip/requirements.txt"

xargs -I_ npm install -g "_" < "$DOTFILES_DIR/exports/npm/npm.txt"

```

> In here, we are installing all dependencies and pacakges from:
> üç∫ Brewfile: _(Cool packages such as: tldr, rbenv, navi, redis, wget)_ <br> 
> üêç Pip for Python <br>
> üßº npm for node packages <br>
> **ü™¥ Important:** If you ever want to include all your current dependencies in this 3 files, you can run `export_packages`, this file is inside exports.sh, file that is explained further in this documentation.


#### ü¶¶ About `.zshrc`(Your main terminal config, here we are configuring zim plus bringing some dependencies)

```zsh
# Import all shell partials isnide shell/lib (functions and aliases, check them out)
source "$HOME/.dotfiles/shell/init.sh"



# -----------------Import Lazy functions inside shell/lib/functions/imports.sh
iruby
# inode
# ipython

# You are setting the Zim location here:
ZIM_HOME=${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim

# This is a large code bit checks if zimfw plugin manager if missing, and downloads it.
if [[ ! -e ${ZIM_HOME}/zimfw.zsh ]]; then
# [...]
fi

# This is super important, it downloads missing modules and updates ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh if missing or outdated.
if [[ ! ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh -nt ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zimrc ]]; then
  source ${ZIM_HOME}/zimfw.zsh init -q
fi


# This will initialize modules for you.
source ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh
```


#### ü¶¶ About [ZIM](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw#set-up-zshrc):

- zimfw plugin manager installs modules at `~/.zim/modules`.
- This modules are installed but need to be initialized, so this creates a static script at `~/.zim/init.zsh`
- The modules you want to use are defined in `~/.zimrc ` (This file just configures our plugin manager zimfw)

So in a nutshell, you can think of `~/.zimrc` as a list of modules you want to use, when you run `zimfw install`, it will download the modules and create a static script at `~/.zim/init.zsh` that will initialize the modules for you.

#### More about our zimfw plugin manager:

- Add new modules to `~/.zimrc`: `zimfw install`
- Remove modules from `~/.zimrc`: `zimfw uninstall`
- Update your modules to their latest revisions: `zimfw update`
- Upgrade zimfw to its latest version: `zimfw upgrade`
