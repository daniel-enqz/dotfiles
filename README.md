chsh -s $(which zsh)
````

#### How it works:

- zimfw plugin manager installs modules at `~/.zim/modules`.
- This modules are installed but need to be initialized, so this creates a static script at `~/.zim/init.zsh`
- The modules you want to use are defined in `~/.zimrc ` (This is the initial config file we build)

#### Some interesting lines in zshrc

   ```zsh
   # You are setting the Zim location here:
   ZIM_HOME=${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zim
   
   # This is a large code bit checks if zimfw plugin manager if missing, and downloads it.
   if [[ ! -e ${ZIM_HOME}/zimfw.zsh ]]; then
   # [...]
   fi
   
   # This is super important, it downloads missing modules and updates ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh if missing or outdated.
   if [[ ! ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh -nt ${ZDOTDIR:-${HOME}}/.zimrc ]]; then
     source ${ZIM_HOME}/zimfw.zsh init -q
   fi

   
   # This will initialize modules for you.
   source ${ZIM_HOME}/init.zsh
   ```
