# Go for Visual Studio Code

[![Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-gophers-green.svg?style=flat)](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/vscode/)

<!--TODO: We should add a badge for the build status or link to the build dashboard.-->

[The VS Code Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)
provides rich language support for the
[Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

üì£
[Remote attach debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#connecting-to-headless-delve-with-target-specified-at-server-start-up) is now available via Delve's native DAP implementation with Delve v1.7.3 or newer. It enchances remote debugging with the same
[debugging features](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging) that are already in use for local debugging. It is now the default with the
[Go Nightly](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/nightly) build of the extension and will become the default for the stable releases in mid 2022.
We recommend switching your remote attach configurations in `launch.json` to use
`"debugAdapter":"dlv-dap"` now to verify that this works for you.
Please [file a new issue](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/new/choose) if you encounter any problems.

üì£üì£ Watch [Debugging Treasure Hunt](https://youtu.be/ZPIPPRjwg7Q) from [GopherCon 2021](https://www.gophercon.com/) for a fun take on a debugging demo with VS Code Go and Delve DAP.

## Quick Start

Welcome! üëãüèª<br/>
Whether you are new to Go or an experienced Go developer, we hope this
extension fits your needs and enhances your development experience.

1.  Install [Go](https://golang.org) 1.14 or newer if you haven't already.

1.  Install the [VS Code Go extension].

1.  Open any directory or workspace containing Go code to automatically activate
    the extension. The
    [Go status bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui) appears in the
    bottom left corner of the window and displays your Go version.

1.  The extension depends on `go`, `gopls`, `dlv` and other optional tools. If
    any of the dependencies are missing, the ‚ö†Ô∏è `Analysis Tools Missing` warning
    is displayed. Click on the warning to download dependencies.

    See the
    [tools documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools) for a
    complete list of tools the extension depends on.

You are ready to Go :-) &nbsp;&nbsp; üéâüéâüéâ

## What's next

* Explore more [features](#features) of the VS Code Go extension.
* Learn how to [customize](#customization) your settings.
* Solve issues with
  [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/troubleshooting).
* [file an issue](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/new/choose) for
  problems with the extension.
* Start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/discussions)
  or get help on [Stack Overflow].

If you are new to Go, [this article](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) provides
the overview on Go code organization and basic `go` commands. Watch ["Getting
started with VS Code Go"] for an explanation of how to build your first Go
application using VS Code Go.

## Feature highlights

* [IntelliSense] - Results appear for symbols as you type.
* [Code navigation] - Jump to or peek at a symbol's declaration.
* [Code editing] - Support for saved snippets, formatting and code organization,
  and automatic organization of imports.
* [Diagnostics] -  Build, vet, and lint errors shown as you type or on save.
* Enhanced support for [testing] and [debugging]

See the [full feature breakdown] for more details.

<em>(Code completion and Signature Help)</em>
</p>

In addition to integrated editing features, the extension provides several
commands for working with Go files. You can access any of these by opening the
Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), and
then typing in the command name. See the
[full list of commands](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/commands#detailed-list) provided by this
extension.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: the default syntax highlighting for Go files is provided by a
[TextMate rule](https://github.com/jeff-hykin/better-go-syntax) embedded in VS
Code, not by this extension.

For better syntax highlighting, we recommend enabling
[semantic highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide)
by turning on [Gopls' `ui.semanticTokens` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#uisemantictokens).
    ```
    "gopls": { "ui.semanticTokens": true }
    ```

## Tools

The extension uses a few command-line tools developed by the Go community. In
particular, `go`, `gopls`, and `dlv` **must** be installed for this extension
to work correctly. See the [tools documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools) for a complete
list of tools the extension depends on.

In order to locate these command-line tools, the extension searches
`GOPATH/bin` and directories specified in the `PATH` environment variable (or
`Path` on Windows) with which the VS Code process has started. If the tools are
not found, the extension will prompt you to install the missing tools and show
the "‚ö†Ô∏è Analysis Tools Missing" warning in the bottom right corner. Please
install them by responding to the warning notification, or by manually running
the [`Go: Install/Update Tools` command].

## Setting up your workspace

[Go modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod) are how Go manages dependencies in
recent versions of Go. Modules replace the `GOPATH`-based approach to specifying
which source files are used in a given build, and they are the default build
mode in go1.16+. While this extension continues to support both Go modules and
`GOPATH` modes, we highly recommend Go development in module mode. If you are
working on existing projects, please consider migrating to modules.

Unlike the traditional `GOPATH` mode, module mode does not require the workspace
to be located under `GOPATH` nor to use a specific structure. A module is
defined by a directory tree of Go source files with a `go.mod` file in the
tree's root directory.

Your project may involve one or more modules. If you are working with multiple
modules or uncommon project layouts, you will need to configure your workspace
by using [Workspace Folders]. Please see this [documentation about supported
workspace layouts].

## Customization

The extension needs no configuration and should work out of the box. However,
you may wish to adjust settings to customize its behavior. Please see the
[settings documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings) for a comprehensive list of settings.
See [advanced topics](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/advanced) for further customizations and unique
use cases.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension isn't working as you expect, you can take a look at our
troubleshooting guides. There is one for [general
troubleshooting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/troubleshooting), and another specifically for
[troubleshooting the debugging feature](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#troubleshooting).

## Ask for help

If the troubleshooting guides did not resolve the issue, please reach out to us
by [filing an issue](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/new/choose),
[starting a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/discussions),
or by asking a question on [Stack Overflow].

Also, you can take a look at [go.dev/learn](https://go.dev/learn) and
[golang.org/help](https://golang.org/help) for more general guidance on using
Go.
